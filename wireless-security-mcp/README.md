# Wireless Security MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for wireless security testing that integrates aircrack-ng, kismet, and wifite tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **WPS Attacks**: WPS PIN and Pixie-Dust attacks
- **PMKID Capture**: Clientless PMKID capture for modern routers
- **Handshake Cracking**: Automated dictionary attacks
- **Session Management**: Save and resume testing sessions

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- aircrack-ng suite (aircrack-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, airmon-ng)
- kismet
- wifite (v2)

### Optional Tools (for enhanced functionality)
- reaver (WPS attacks)
- bully (alternative WPS tool)
- cowpatty (WPA-PSK cracking)
- pyrit (GPU-accelerated cracking)
- hashcat (advanced password cracking)

### System Requirements
- Linux operating system (Kali Linux recommended)
- Wireless adapter with monitor mode and injection support
- Root/sudo privileges

## Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
```bash
cd wireless-security-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Install required tools:
```bash
# On Kali Linux (recommended)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng kismet wifite

# Optional tools
sudo apt install reaver bully cowpatty pyrit hashcat
```

3. **Configure Sudo Access** (Required for wireless operations):

**Option A: Passwordless Sudo (Recommended for testing environments)**
```bash
sudo visudo
# Add this line (replace 'username' with your actual username):
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

**Option B: Linux Capabilities (More Secure)**
```bash
cd wireless-security-mcp
chmod +x setup-capabilities.sh
sudo ./setup-capabilities.sh
# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
```

**Option C: Restricted Sudoers (Specific Commands Only)**
```bash
sudo cp wireless-mcp-sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/wireless-mcp-sudoers
```

4. Configure your Claude desktop app to use this server by adding to your MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wireless-security-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/wireless-security-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Start Claude Code**:
```bash
# If you configured passwordless sudo:
claude

# Or use the enhanced startup scripts:
./start-claude-enhanced.sh --check-permissions  # Check setup
./start-claude-enhanced.sh --normal            # Normal mode
./start-claude-enhanced.sh --sudo              # Sudo mode (if needed)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scanning
```javascript
// Enable monitor mode
await aircrack_monitor_mode({
  interface: "wlan0",
  enable: true
});

// Scan for networks
const networks = await aircrack_scan_networks({
  interface: "wlan0mon",
  timeout: 30
});
```

### Capture WPA Handshake
```javascript
// Target specific network
await aircrack_capture_handshake({
  interface: "wlan0mon",
  bssid: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  channel: 6,
  timeout: 300
});
```

### Automated Testing with Wifite
```javascript
// Automated audit of all networks
await wifite_auto_audit({
  interface: "wlan0",
  timeout: 600,
  minimumPower: -70
});

// Target specific network
await wifite_target_network({
  interface: "wlan0",
  bssid: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  attackMode: "wpa"
});
```

### Kismet Server Operations
```javascript
// Start Kismet server
await kismet_start_server({
  interface: "wlan0",
  port: 2501
});

// Scan and export data
const networks = await kismet_scan_networks({
  timeout: 60
});

await kismet_export_data({
  outputFile: "/tmp/capture.json",
  format: "json"
});
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Legal Compliance**: Only test networks you own or have written permission to test
2. **Ethical Use**: Use these tools responsibly and ethically
3. **Target Validation**: The server includes warnings but cannot prevent misuse
4. **Sudo Requirements**: Most operations require root privileges
5. **Interface Validation**: Only standard wireless interfaces are allowed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Tool not installed" errors**
   - Ensure all required tools are installed
   - Check PATH environment variable
   - Run with sudo if needed

2. **"Invalid interface" errors**
   - Verify interface name with `iwconfig`
   - Ensure wireless adapter supports monitor mode
   - Check if interface is already in use

3. **"Operation requires root privileges"**
   - Run the MCP server with sudo
   - Configure sudoers for specific commands

4. **Monitor mode issues**
   - Kill conflicting processes: `sudo airmon-ng check kill`
   - Try manual mode: `sudo ip link set wlan0 down && sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control`
